Things u can add/change (in my opinion)

-----CANTEEN----
- You have to add gas stove between two gas cabinets
- You have to add the food/bill counter
- can add more Covid/Canteen related images to wall(Midwall, Front wall)


-----LIBRARY----
- Add a help desk(i found one 3d model but its color is white i dont know why its showing in white color - u can find desk ka 3d model in Models ka folder which i kwept separate)
- Add a sofa (same that is there) right wall k udhar in opposite direction to the sofa which is already there
- add desktops in a row (direction u may choose - i mean kis taraf face karega vo)
- add few more bookshelves to the left side wall (one is already there just replicate that particular code and change position)
- add few more plants every corner of the library area(bookshelves k baaju me back wall k)(everything else seems fine for me else u can change as per ur needs)

-----IN GENERAL------
